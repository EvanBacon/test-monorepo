# Expo Config Plugins

A collection of custom WIP config plugins for Expo dev clients. Use at your own discretion.


## Creating a plugin

- Plugins can be generated by running `yarn gen`.
- Add plugins to the example in [`apps/app`](/apps/app/package.json) to test them.
- The example app should always stay in a state of regeneration.
